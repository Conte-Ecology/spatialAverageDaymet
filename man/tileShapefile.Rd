\title{Break shapefile into tiles}
\usage{
tileShapefile(shapefile, tileDegree)
}
\arguments{
\item{shapefile}{A SpatialPolygonsDataFrame of the zones which will be assigned climate records. The object should be in the WGS geographic coordinate system (same as the Daymet NetCDF files,The proj4string = "+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +towgs84=0,0,0").}

\item{tileDegree}{A numeric value of either 1 or 2 indicating the length of the tile edge in lat/lon degrees.}
}
\description{
\code{tileShapefile} breaks up large shapefiles into up into 2 degree tiles to keep R from having memory issues when reading Daymet records.
}
\details{
Polygons are assigned to tiles based on where their centroids are located.
This function only works for shapefiles with units that are lat/lon. Make sure the shapefile is in the daymet coordinate system before running this function on it.
