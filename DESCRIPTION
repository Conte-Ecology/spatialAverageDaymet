Package: zonalDaymet
Title: A toolset to process Daymet climate records
Version: 1.0
Authors@R: person("Kyle", "O'Neil", email = "koneil@usgs.gov", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: The package provides tools to download NetCDF climate mosaics 
	from the Daymet THREDDS Server, spatially average climate records over 
	user-specified spatial polygons, process shapefiles into manageable 
	pieces within the R environment to avoid memory issues, and return 
	subsets from the climate mosaics given latitude/longitude coordinate bounds.
	Functionality is provided to return spatial averages as either a dataframe 
	in the current R environment or write directly to SQLite database. A function
	is available to simplify selecting records from the database.
